### Wind energy forecasting 

This project aims at modeling and forecasting wind energy generation for a wind farm in Western Denmark Horns Rev with a nominal capacity of 160MW, while the weather forecast input information is from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF - ecmwf.int), the world-leading research and operational weather forecasting centre.

The project is for a wind-forecasting competition held at Technical University of Denmark and inspired by the recent Global Energy Forecasting Competitions held in 2012 and 2014 held on <a url=https://www.kaggle.com>kaggle.com</a>
